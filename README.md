# template-repos-cjs-esm

1. Remove `elliptic` and `@types/elliptic` (`yarn remove elliptic @types/elliptic`) because they are just an example package.
2. Edit `index.ts` and install all related packages
3. Push the repository and install it as a git package (e.g., `yarn add https://github.com/dev-protocol/template-repos-cjs-esm.git`)
